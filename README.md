# Sound Meter (Q3)

Microphone-driven decibel meter that visualizes ambient noise levels.

- Uses `AudioRecord` to sample audio and convert amplitude into dB estimates.
- Progress bar / colored meter rises with louder sounds for quick at-a-glance feedback.
- Triggers an alert when the reading crosses a defined noise threshold.
- Useful for gauging room loudness or testing microphone input.
